# btd6-paragon-calculator
I'm tired to opening the wiki every time I want to make a max degree paragon so now I'm making a calculator

## Max level paragon requires
* 16.2 mil pops
* $250k non-tier 5 towers
* 100 upgrades
* 9 tier 5 towers (max 3-4 single player)

## Plans
* Accept user input/selection for tower
* Calculate how many x-x-x of a given tower you need to reach $250,000 spent
* Make calculator with above variables
